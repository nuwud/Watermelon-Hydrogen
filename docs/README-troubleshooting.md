# üõ†Ô∏è Hydrogen + Three.js Troubleshooting Guide

## üß© Common Issues & Fixes

### ‚ùå `window is not defined`
**Cause:** Three.js or other browser-only code was run during server-side rendering (SSR).

**Fix:**
```js
if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
  // Safe browser code here
}
```

### ‚ùå 3D Scene Doesn't Show Up on Live Site

**Fix:**
1. Make sure you pushed to `main`.
2. Visit Shopify Admin ‚Üí Hydrogen ‚Üí Storefronts ‚Üí Set your new Hydrogen app as **Live**.

### ‚ùå Scroll Zooming Instead of Rotating Carousel
**Cause:** `OrbitControls` default zoom behavior was not disabled.

**Fix:** In `main.js` or wherever `OrbitControls` is used:
```js
controls.enableZoom = false;
// Use mouse button press + move for zoom instead
```

### ‚ùå Deployment 404 / PR Blocking Main
