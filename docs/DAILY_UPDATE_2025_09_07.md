# Daily Update — 2025-09-07

Comprehensive notes for today’s stabilization and cleanup work on main.

## Summary
- Main is the source of truth and up to date.
- Resolved merge conflicts across key 3D components and cart HUD.
- Normalized GLTFLoader to use dynamic imports everywhere (SSR-safe, creates its own client chunk).
- Restored Remix API route internals where they had been overwritten by UI.
- Fixed GraphQL codegen instability (duplicate operation name, broadened globs, placeholder present).
- Cleaned ESLint signal and verified builds (client and SSR) are green.
- Archived dev variant file to backup to avoid confusion.

## Actions Taken
- Resolve conflicts and align patterns:
  - Adopted ensureGLTFLoader() dynamic import pattern across 3D components.
  - Cleaned hooks usage and effect dependencies.
- Route restoration:
  - Reinstated proper loader/handler in `app/routes/api.products-3d.jsx` and corrected fragment import path.
- Codegen stabilization:
  - Renamed duplicate GraphQL operation (CollectionFor3DMenu), expanded `.graphqlrc.js` globs, added customer-account placeholder.
- Lint and hygiene:
  - Tightened ESLint ignores (dist, backup, dev-workspace, and `*_WORKING.*`).
  - Removed redundant disables and unused imports.
- Dev artifact archiving:
  - Moved `app/components/Carousel3DPro/Carousel3DSubmenu_WORKING.js` → `backup/components/Carousel3DPro/Carousel3DSubmenu_WORKING.js`.
- Build verification:
  - Production client build green; GLTFLoader emitted as a separate chunk.
  - SSR build green.

## Files Touched (high level)
- 3D components (dynamic GLTFLoader, hooks hygiene):
  - `app/components/Carousel3DPro/Carousel3DSubmenu.js`
  - `app/components/Carousel3DPro/Carousel3DSubmenuEnhanced.jsx`
  - `app/components/Carousel3DPro/CentralContentPanelEnhanced.jsx`
  - `app/components/Carousel3DPro/Product3DDisplay.js`
  - `app/components/cart-drawers/CartHUDIcon3D.js`
- Route restore:
  - `app/routes/api.products-3d.jsx`
- GraphQL/codegen:
  - `app/lib/fragments.js` (unique operation name)
  - `.graphqlrc.js` (broadened globs)
  - `app/graphql/customer-account/placeholder.js` (placeholder)
- Lint config:
  - `eslint.config.js` (ignores and minor cleanup)
- Archive move:
  - `backup/components/Carousel3DPro/Carousel3DSubmenu_WORKING.js`

## Verification
- Builds: client and SSR succeeded; GLTFLoader split into its own client chunk (~45kB range).
- No remaining merge conflicts on main.
- ESLint signal clean on active app sources; backup/dev artifacts ignored as intended.

## Notes and Rationale
- Dynamic import standardization improves SSR safety and reduces initial bundle size.
- Keeping dev variants in `backup/` prevents accidental imports and noisy lint/build output.
- Unique GraphQL operation names and broadened globs prevent codegen regressions when folders shift.

## Follow-ups (nice-to-have)
- Add a guard for onProgress calculations when total is undefined (avoid NaN in percentage logs).
- Audit GLB vs GLTF asset paths for consistency across components.
- Quick smoke test in preview/deploy: 3D interactions, SSR routes, cart drawer open/close after scene loads.

## How to Validate Locally
- Start dev server and load the 3D routes; check for SSR safety (no window access before mount) and absence of console errors.
- Optionally run a production build to verify chunking remains stable after changes.
