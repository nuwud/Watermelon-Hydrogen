## üìà What This Unlocks (Next Steps)

- Build immersive product interfaces with GLTF or 3D menus
- Hook up recurring payments with Stripe or Recharge
- Control 3D experiences from metafields or admin HUD
- Fetch/store customer data with Customer Account API
- Trigger authenticated sessions using OAuth

---

## üõ† Developer Notes

To avoid `window is not defined` SSR errors:
```js
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  // Safe to run Three.js or DOM logic
}
```

To render Three.js only on the client:
```jsx
<ClientOnly>
  <Carousel3DProWrapper />
</ClientOnly>
```
